# isle-of-hope
This is a WIP personal audio-visual website.
https://bagaski.github.io/isle-of-hope/

There is one introduction page wich links to the first landscape. Eventually I would like to introduce more pages and they should be more interactive, featuring different audio and landscapes, using mainly HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. 

 Possible future senarios:

--> colours from page to page

--> interactions

--> audio (web audio api?)

--> animations (canvas?)

--> navigation 

--> text

--> narrative
