# isle-of-hope
This is a WIP personal audio-visual website.
https://bagaski.github.io/isle-of-hope/

There is one introduction page wich links to the first landscape. Eventually I would like to introduce more pages and they should be more interactive, featuring different audio and landscapes. 

I will stick to html, css and vanilla js for this project. Consider the following:

--> colours from page to page

--> interactions

--> audio (web audio api?)

--> animations (canvas?)

--> navigation 

--> text

--> narrative
